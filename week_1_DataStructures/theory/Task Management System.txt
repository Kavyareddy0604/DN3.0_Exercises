1. Understand Linked Lists
Singly Linked List:

Description: A singly linked list is a data structure where each element (node) contains a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. It allows traversal in one direction—from the head to the end of the list.
Structure:
Node: Contains the data and a reference to the next node.
Head: The first node in the list.
Doubly Linked List:

Description: A doubly linked list is a data structure where each node contains references to both the next and the previous node, allowing traversal in both directions.
Structure:
Node: Contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
Head: The first node.
Tail: The last node, which points to null for the next reference and null for the previous reference.

4. Analysis
Time Complexity:

Add Task:

Best Case: O(1) – Adding to an empty list or the beginning of the list.
Average Case: O(n) – If the list needs to be traversed to find the end.
Worst Case: O(n) – If the list is large and the task is added at the end.
Search Task:

Best Case: O(1) – If the task is at the beginning of the list.
Average Case: O(n) – If the task is somewhere in the middle.
Worst Case: O(n) – If the task is at the end or not present.
Traverse Tasks:

Time Complexity: O(n) – Requires iterating through all tasks.
Delete Task:

Best Case: O(1) – If deleting the head node.
Average Case: O(n) – If the task is somewhere in the middle.
Worst Case: O(n) – If the task is at the end or not present.
Advantages of Linked Lists Over Arrays:

Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically without needing to resize or shift elements, unlike arrays.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Adding or removing elements, especially at the beginning or middle of the list, is more efficient in linked lists compared to arrays where shifting is required.
No Wasted Space: Linked lists do not need to allocate extra space as arrays do, which can lead to better memory utilization when the size of the data set changes frequently.
Linked lists are particularly advantageous for scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions are expected, and the size of the dataset varies over time. They are less efficient for scenarios where random access is needed due to their linear time complexity for accessing elements.
