1. Understand the Problem
Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms:

Efficiency: With large inventories, efficient storage and retrieval are crucial to ensure the system can handle a significant number of products without performance degradation.
Scalability: As the inventory grows, the system must be able to scale effectively. Choosing the right data structures helps manage this growth efficiently.
Speed: Efficient algorithms ensure that operations like adding, updating, and deleting products are performed quickly.
Types of Data Structures:

ArrayList: Useful for scenarios where you need dynamic resizing and fast random access but slower insertions and deletions.
HashMap: Provides constant time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups, making it ideal for fast retrieval based on unique keys.
TreeMap: Useful for ordered data with log-time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups. Suitable if you need to maintain sorted order.

4. Analysis
Time Complexity:

Add Product: O(1) – Insertion into HashMap is constant time on average.
Update Product: O(1) – Updating a value in HashMap is also constant time.
Delete Product: O(1) – Removal from HashMap is constant time.
Optimizations:

HashMap Resizing: Ensure that the load factor and initial capacity are set appropriately to minimize resizing operations.
Concurrency: If the system needs to be thread-safe, consider using ConcurrentHashMap or other synchronization mechanisms.
Feel free to adjust the implementation based on specific requirements or constraints!
