1. Understand Asymptotic Notation
Big O Notation:

Definition: Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity, representing the worst-case scenario of how the runtime grows relative to the input size.
Purpose: It helps analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms, providing insights into their scalability and performance.
Search Operation Scenarios:

Best Case: The search algorithm finds the target element on the first attempt. For example, in linear search, this happens if the target is the first element of the array.
Average Case: The search algorithm performs on average half of the possible operations. For linear search, this is the average number of comparisons needed to find the target.
Worst Case: The search algorithm requires the maximum number of operations. For linear search, this is when the target is at the end of the array or not present.

4. Analysis
Time Complexity:

Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) – The target is the first element.
Average Case: O(n) – The target is somewhere in the array.
Worst Case: O(n) – The target is not present or at the end of the array.
Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) – The target is the middle element.
Average Case: O(log n) – The array is divided in half with each step.
Worst Case: O(log n) – The target is not found, but the number of divisions is logarithmic.
Suitability:

Binary Search: More suitable for large datasets where the array is sorted, due to its logarithmic time complexity.
Linear Search: Simpler to implement but less efficient for large datasets. It is more suitable when the array is unsorted or very small.
Binary search is generally preferred for performance in larger, sorted datasets, while linear search might be used in scenarios where simplicity is favored or the data is not sorted.
