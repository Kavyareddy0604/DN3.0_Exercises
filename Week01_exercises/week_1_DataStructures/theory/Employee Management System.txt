1. Understand Array Representation
Arrays in Memory:

Representation: Arrays are a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element can be accessed directly using its index.
Advantages:
Direct Access: Allows constant-time access to elements (O(1)) using indices.
Simplicity: Easy to implement and use for basic operations.
Cache Friendliness: Due to contiguous memory allocation, arrays are cache-friendly, leading to efficient access patterns.
Limitations:

Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size once created. This makes dynamic resizing challenging without creating new arrays.
Costly Insertions/Deletions: Inserting or deleting elements requires shifting elements, leading to linear time complexity (O(n)).

4. Analysis
Time Complexity:

Add Employee:

Best Case: O(1) – Adding to a non-full array.
Average Case: O(1) – Adding when the array is resized infrequently.
Worst Case: O(n) – When resizing occurs, which involves copying elements to a new array.
Search Employee:

Best Case: O(1) – If the employee is at the beginning.
Average Case: O(n) – If the employee is somewhere in the middle.
Worst Case: O(n) – If the employee is at the end or not present.
Traverse Employees:

Time Complexity: O(n) – Requires iterating through all employees.
Delete Employee:

Best Case: O(1) – If the employee is at the end.
Average Case: O(n) – If the employee is somewhere in the middle.
Worst Case: O(n) – When the employee is at the beginning, involving shifting all subsequent elements.
Limitations of Arrays:

Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size which may require resizing for dynamic additions.
Costly Operations: Inserting and deleting elements involves shifting, leading to linear time complexity.
When to Use Arrays:

Simple, Fixed-Size Collections: When the number of elements is known in advance and does not change frequently.
Memory Efficiency: When memory overhead needs to be minimized and the simplicity of direct access is valued.
Arrays are useful for scenarios where fixed-size collections are acceptable, and direct access is needed. For more dynamic scenarios with frequent insertions and deletions, other data structures like ArrayList, LinkedList, or HashMap might be more appropriate.
