1. Understand Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort:

Description: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n) – When the array is already sorted.
Average Case: O(n^2) – Due to nested loops.
Worst Case: O(n^2) – When the array is in reverse order.
Insertion Sort:

Description: Builds the sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly taking the next item and inserting it into the correct position within the already sorted portion.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n) – When the array is already sorted.
Average Case: O(n^2) – With nested loops for insertion.
Worst Case: O(n^2) – When the array is sorted in reverse order.
Quick Sort:

Description: Divides the array into sub-arrays around a pivot element, such that elements less than the pivot come before it, and elements greater come after it. Recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n) – When the pivot divides the array evenly.
Average Case: O(n log n) – With good pivot selection.
Worst Case: O(n^2) – When the pivot is the smallest or largest element.
Merge Sort:

Description: Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n log n) – Always divides the array into halves.
Average Case: O(n log n) – Consistent with dividing and merging.
Worst Case: O(n log n) – Consistent with dividing and merging.


4. Analysis
Performance Comparison:

Bubble Sort:

Best Case: O(n) when the array is already sorted.
Average Case: O(n^2) due to nested loops.
Worst Case: O(n^2) when the array is sorted in reverse order.
Quick Sort:

Best Case: O(n log n) when the pivot divides the array evenly.
Average Case: O(n log n) with good pivot selection.
Worst Case: O(n^2) when the pivot is the smallest or largest element (but this can be mitigated with better pivot selection strategies).
Why Quick Sort is Preferred:

Efficiency: Quick Sort is generally more efficient with its average-case time complexity of O(n log n), compared to Bubble Sort’s O(n^2).
Scalability: Quick Sort scales better with larger datasets due to its logarithmic time complexity.
In-Place Sorting: Quick Sort sorts in place, which means it doesn’t require additional memory for sorting.
Overall, Quick Sort is typically favored for its performance advantages in handling large datasets compared to Bubble Sort.
